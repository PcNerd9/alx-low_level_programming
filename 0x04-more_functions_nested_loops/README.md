## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are to:

- Deepen the understanding of functions and nested loops in C.
- Learn to implement various functions that demonstrate more complex operations.
- Practice building algorithms for solving specific problems.

## Functions

This project features a variety of functions designed to perform specific tasks. Here are some examples of the functions included:

- **0-isupper.c**: A function that checks for uppercase characters.
- **1-isdigit.c**: A function that checks for digits.
- **2-mul.c**: A function that multiplies two integers.
- **3-print_numbers.c**: A function that prints numbers from 0 to 9.
- **4-print_most_numbers.c**: A function that prints numbers from 0 to 9, excluding 2 and 4.
- **5-more_numbers.c**: A function that prints numbers from 0 to 14 ten times.
- **6-print_line.c**: A function that draws a straight line in the terminal.
- **7-print_diagonal.c**: A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
- **8-print_square.c**: A function that prints a square.
- **9-fizz_buzz.c**: A function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, substituting "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
- **10-print_triangle.c**: A function that prints a triangle using `#` characters.
- **101-print_number.c**: A function that prints an integer without using `printf`.

## Nested Loops

Nested loops are utilized in several functions in this project to handle repetitive tasks and multi-dimensional data structures. Understanding how to implement nested loops effectively is crucial for solving complex problems.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Define and use functions effectively in C.
- Implement nested loops to manage complex data operations.
- Understand how to construct algorithms for solving specific problems.
