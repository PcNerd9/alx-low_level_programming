# File Input/Output (I/O) Handling Repository

This repository is a comprehensive guide to understanding the concept of File I/O handling and its practical implementation in C programming. Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the basics or an experienced developer seeking advanced insights, this repository has you covered.

## Table of Contents

### 1. `0-read_textfile.c`
- **Function:** `ssize_t read_textfile(const char *filename, size_t letters)`
- **Description:** This function reads a text file and prints its content to the POSIX standard output. It provides a fundamental understanding of reading files and working with data.

### 2. `1-create_file.c`
- **Function:** `int create_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)`
- **Description:** This function creates a new file with the specified filename and writes the given text content to it. It explores the creation and writing aspects of file handling.

### 3. `2-append_text_to_file.c`
- **Function:** `int append_text_to_file(const char *filename, char *text_content)`
- **Description:** This function appends text to the end of an existing file, demonstrating how to add content to files without overwriting existing data.

### 4. `3-cp.c`
- **Program:** File Copy
- **Description:** This program copies the content of one file to another file. It showcases file-to-file data transfer, an essential skill in file manipulation.

### 5. `100-elf_header.c`
- **Program:** ELF Header Viewer
- **Description:** This program displays the information contained in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) header at the start of an ELF file. It delves into the specifics of binary file analysis.

## Concepts Explored

1. **Opening Files**
   - Understanding how to open files for reading, writing, or both.
   - Handling potential errors when opening files.

2. **Reading and Writing Data**
   - Learning how to read and write data to/from files using functions like `fread()` and `fwrite()`.
   - Managing data buffers and handling different data types.

3. **Appending Data**
   - Exploring techniques to append data to existing files without overwriting the content.

4. **Copying Files**
   - Implementing a file copy program to transfer data from one file to another.

5. **Binary File Analysis (ELF Header)**
   - Understanding the structure of binary files, focusing on ELF files.
   - Extracting and displaying critical information from binary file headers.
