## Project Overview

The main goals of this project are to:

- Understand and utilize variables in C.
- Implement conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`).
- Utilize loops (`while` and `for`) for iteration.

## Variables

In C, variables are used to store data. They must be declared with a specific type, such as `int`, `float`, or `char`. Hereâ€™s an example of variable declaration and initialization:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int age = 21;
    printf("Age: %d\n", age);
    return 0;
}
